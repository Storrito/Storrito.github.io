Instagram is a mobile-only platform. For many agencies or bloggers the mobile focus makes it really hard to schedule stories in advance. Therefore some platforms have been developed which enable you to schedule stories from desktop but they don't provide editors to add Instagram specific stickers, like #Hashtags. Besides time scheduling, itâ€™s really important to prepare your Instagram story with the appropriate tags and swipe-up links etc. to reach your followers and grow your audience. [Storrito](https://app.storrito.com) provides an editor which enables you to prepare your images or videos, for your Instagram story from the desktop.
