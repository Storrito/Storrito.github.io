Instagram Stories are a great, fun way for your business to connect with customers while increasing
your brand visibility at the same time. With a scheduling tool for Instagram Stories you can not only
boost engagement and get more followers, but also save time and better curate your content.

Out of all the social media platforms, Instagram is certainly the one where people engage the most.
However, apart from featuring your company or brand in your feed, it is also important for businesses
to show up on Instagram Stories— especially because they are so popular with users.

According to Statista, users worldwide upload around 500 million stories per day. Even though stories
normally disappear after 24 hours, they have one great advantage: they are discoverable. This means
that everybody can see your story, whereas only your followers can see new content in your feed.
Instagram Stories are therefore a unique way for businesses to increase brand awareness and to also
connect to new users. Creating Instagram Stories is also fun and playful, which allows you to be more
creative in your stories and catch user's attention faster.

At the same time, curating content and creating Instagram Stories takes time, which is why scheduling
tools can be so helpful.

Scheduling tools let you plan and schedule stories from your desktop by simply using your browser,
which will save you time, boost engagement and help you gain more followers.

## Why you should plan your Instagram Stories

Yes, Instagram Stories are meant to be spontaneous, but if you are running a business, there is only so
much time you can spend on creating social media content.

So, you can either spend one hour every day thinking about the best content, finding good pictures or
taking new ones, and coming up with the best hashtags. Or, you can sit down for two hours one day a
week and create and plan your content for the whole week.

Planning your week's content all at once, you get a better overview of your posts and can curate and
tweak it more carefully as opposed to uploading it piece by piece each day.

It allows for everything from hand-picking specific content for each day to tying in Instagram Stories
with marketing campaigns and repurposing content that did well on other platforms. Aligning your
Instagram Stories with your marketing and business strategy becomes really easy that way.

Also, taking the time to plan several Instagram Stories at once will make it easier to give your brand a
consistent look and feel that users will be able to recognize.

And that's exactly where free scheduling tools such as Storrito come in. They allow you to plan stories
from your desktop – which is probably where you edit most of your pictures and videos anyway – and
let you schedule Instagram Stories in just a few steps.
