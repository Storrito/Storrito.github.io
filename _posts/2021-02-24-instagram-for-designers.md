Instagram has emerged as the most viral social media platform that predominantly dictates visual content to please audiences and users.
Images and videos rule the timelines of Instagram users. This is why it has not only become a source of inspiration for many designers out there but also provides them with the drive to showcase their unique talents and artistic expressions.

Many designers nowadays are now using the platform to build authenticity around their work through their strong sense of style and distinctiveness.

According to a recent study by Oberlo, there are over 1 billion monthly active users on Instagram, with more than 500 million daily users.

Furthermore, the average post on Instagram contains 10.7 hashtags and 71% of all Instagram users under the age of 35 years old.

Moreover, Instagram users spend 53 minutes every day on the platform, and at least 71% of US businesses utilizing it for their promotional activities. Instagram sponsored content has grown by 133% from February 2018 to February 2019.

In light of this information, let’s take a quick look at how designers can get the most out of using hashtags on Instagram.

## 1. Number of Hashtags to Use

While Instagram allows you to use up to 30 hashtags in a single post, however, it is best advised to stick to no more than 11 hashtags. While hashtags make your content easy to find for relative audiences, using too many hashtags can dilute their effect. Many professionals would often consider using only one or three hashtags, considering that they are strong and reflect high engagement from targeted Instagram users.

It would help if you also considered using hashtags that speak your customer’s language, are community-specific, and related to your industry.

However, hashtags associated with brands take prominence due to their widespread support and fan following. The same goes for celebrities, public figures, popular events, and well-known places or locations.

## 2. Things to Consider

When it comes to your Instagram captions, there is ample space of 2,200 characters for you to play around with and make the best use of for your agenda.

However, it is recommended that you keep your copy brief, which makes the ideal post between 138 to 150 characters. Plus, it would help if you also built an audience persona as that will help your own brand tone and voice as well as help you stay on track.

You need to make sure that your captions are goal-oriented, relevant for your niche market, and address the pain points of your targeted customers. Always put the most important information first while also taking your time to write, re-write, and edit your captions. Here are some ways to make your Instagram captions more engaging:  

### Creating a Contest

A contest is a great way to spark interest in the audience, especially if it is backed with a tangible and noteworthy reward. Make sure you set the eligibility criteria and the rules clearly and in the simplest of words to avoid confusion. You can hold several types of competitions relating to typography, posters, best logo concept, even a Tee design for that matter.  

### Meaningful Content

Another thing you can do with your captions is to ensure that they offer value to your users. They could include news updates, information about local events that are about to happen, public gatherings, or any other important information associated with you and your work.

In fact, you can also create posts to educate your audiences and share them with some vital info that can help them make better choices, delivers the latest research or statistics, and provide meaningful elucidations.

### Telling Your Brand Story

While many would request you to refrain from being too overly self-promoting on Instagram, I, on the other hand, consider that it is an absolute must for you to develop a connection with your audience.

In order to do that, you need to tell them all about yourself, where you started, your current projects, your upcoming work, and future objectives.

Create, for them, a powerful narrative about yourself and your brand that makes you unique and different from the rest so that they are able to distinguish you and recognize your efforts.

In fact, you can create a separate album or series of albums for them to know about your origins, personal work, apprenticeship years, and evolution into a professional designer.
