A browser extension is a plug-in that extends the functionality of your desktop web browser. The Storrito browser extension connects your Instagram account to your Storrito account with one single click. You can easily connect multiple Instagram accounts very fast without the need of your password. We recommend to use Storrito with Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Opera, therefore we offer the browser extension only for these.
