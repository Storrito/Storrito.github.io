## What Is Brand Content?

Brand content is the content you create as a brand for your business profile. Instagram
partnership collaborations with other business accounts also count as branded content.
You can even use a branded content tool like Canva to create visuals for the content of
your business profile, but there are other apps and programs you can use for it too.

## #1 Understanding Your Audience

First of all, you need to accept the simple truth that [understanding your audience](https://blog.hootsuite.com/target-market/) will
always lie at the foundation of your digital marketing strategy and all of its parts such as
social media marketing, email marketing, messenger marketing, and so on. If you don’t
understand who your audience is, you will never be able to create a plan you can follow which
will, in the end, lead you to some kind of success.

To understand your audience, you will need to do extensive research and collect data
that you will then analyze to understand what your target audience wants to see – and then
create the content that will correspond to their expectations. Alternatively, you can
consult experts in your industry who will give you an idea of who your target audience is.

Understanding your audience includes building your customer personas and creating a framework
for your content. For instance, you will need to know the gender, age, location, occupation,
education, income, interests, etc. of your audience. But you will also need a set of rules and
requirements to follow when creating your content. This guide you put together will allow you
to stay consistent with your content and your brand image.

## #2 Sharing Experiences

After you know who your target audience is, you need to start adopting certain tactics when
creating your brand content. One of these includes sharing experiences. Basically, this
tactic means that you use your content to tell a story and share a certain experience that
your audience can either connect with or relate to. And even if your audience can do either
of those, your content can still be interesting enough for your audience to consume.

There are different ways you can share experiences. For example, you can ask your writers to
find stories your customers or even just random people have posted on the Internet that are
relevant to your niche and to the topics you cover. On the other hand, you can ask those very
people who experienced it to write content for you.

Experiences will usually be either entertaining or educational, but all of them will have to
be original to some extent. Otherwise, your content will not be able to stand out from the
crowd and your business profiles will be lost among so many other business profiles on social
media platforms that have bigger follower bases and more high-quality content.

## #3 Making It Emotional

Even though making your content emotional is closely connected to sharing experiences (because
experiences always have some kind of emotions within the story told in the content), making
your content emotional actually means that all of your content – not just the experiences or
stories – is connected to emotions one way or the other.

You can do this by hiring professional writers who know how to incorporate emotional beats into
their articles and transfer these emotions to your audience. A writing service review site like
[Online Writers Rating](https://onlinewritersrating.com/) is a good place to start looking for
such writers because it offers you the ability to compare writers and choose the one that suits
your needs the best.

But your visual content should also be emotional – and it doesn’t always mean that these emotions
should be positive. You can use anger, fear, or disgust in your content as they can be just as
powerful as joy or satisfaction. The goal is to find a way to convey these emotions to your
audience which is looking for content that will make them feel something when they consume it.


## #4 Curating User-Generated ConAna Mayernt

That being said, you don’t always have to create your own [brand content](https://www.logobee.com/logo-maker/)
because user-generated content or UGC can also be used in your social media strategy.
User-generated content is the one created by your followers who are either reviewing your
products or just sharing something they want you to see.

More often than not, people will tag your business account in the posts they want you to see.
Your responsibility is to reply to these posts in some way and, if the content is good enough
for you, share it in some way. You can even share it no matter how good or bad it is because
showing that you care will already mean a lot to your audience.

On Instagram, you can repost the content on your Stories. On Twitter, you can retweet other
people’s tweets. On Facebook, you can share content. And most other social media platforms have
some kind of sharing buttons for you to use when you want to curate UGC.

## #5 Staying Relevant

One of the problems that brands encounter when managing their business social media accounts
is oversaturation. At the same time, many brands can suddenly discover that their content is no
longer relevant to their audience which is a huge problem because it can lead to lower engagement
levels, users unfollowing your account, your reputation worsening, and so many other things you
wouldn’t want your brand to experience.

through all the points and answer all the questions your followers have? Is your posting schedule
good enough or should you post more or less often?

## #6 Relying on Visuals

Last but not least, you should also remember that your social media brand content is not just
text – it’s also the visuals. This is why you need to [create visual content](https://backlinko.com/hub/content/visual)
that will support your Instagram captions, your witty tweets, and your lengthy Facebook articles.

To create high-quality visual content, you will probably need to use certain tools. As mentioned
earlier, Canva is one of them. It will help you edit your photos and put together collages. There
are also different editing programs for beginners that you can use to create GIFs and edit videos
(e.g. GIPHY and Movavi Video Editor).

## Final Thoughts

All in all, Instagram brand partnerships may be useful for your overall digital marketing campaign,
but you need to remember that the main branded content is the one you create for your business
account on your own.
