Instagram is the goto social platform to do online marketing. Especially stories can be used to advertise in an interactive and exclusive way. That being said, long-form audio content like podcasts or music is not meant to be shared on social media - no one wants to listen to audio longer than a few seconds while browsing through Instagram. You cannot even upload audio content via the app.

Sharing teaser videos on Instagram stories offer your some serious advantages:

1. If you got a +10k followers account, you can add a **swipe up link to your newest podcast episode**. Because stories usually convert very well, you can drive huge parts of your Instagram audience to your podcast.
2. You can **add stickers** like questions, locations, hashtags and mentions to make your podcast more interesting. Maybe even reference them within your podcast to build a connection with your audience.
