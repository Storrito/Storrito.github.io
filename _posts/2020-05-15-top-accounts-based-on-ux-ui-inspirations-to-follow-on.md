## Benefits of a Great UX/UI Design

Every dollar invested in UX/UI design could bring more dollars in return. Thus, it’s a wonderful ROI. The following are five [benefits of a well-designed app](https://www.etatvasoft.com/blog/benefits-of-hybrid-mobile-apps-to-customers/):

1. **Consumer Acquisition.** 
Successful design means a competitive edge. Great design is likely to overtake the price factor as the major brand differentiators that draw new customers. Great design is more than effective product design, it is actually good business.

2. **Retention of consumers.**  
Building an intuitive and gorgeous enterprise application, a lot more people would want to use it and most of all keep o using it. In today’s digital world, retention of consumers or customers is all the more important since the competition gets tough with each advancement in technology.

3. **Enhanced productivity.**  
Improved productivity could be achieved with better user experience. When considering improved productivity over the number of users as well as the number of hours that each customer is active, the impact financially is considerably substantial and apparent.

4. **Lesser Support expenses.**  
A well-designed application simply works. An app with an inferior design would require more documentation, training, and support later on, which translates to higher costs. On the other hand, an application that’s intuitive and easy to use causes less stress on both employees and the bottom line.

5. **Lessens time of development.**  
Half of the time spent on engineering is doing re-works to fix errors that may have been avoided in the first place. These errors could include confusing navigation that causes a user to get stuck or lost, wrong user behavior assumptions or a new feature no one wants to use or even an inaccessible design. Making certain that the design is right and well done the first time around prevents all feature headaches.

## Conclusion

Today, with the technology evolving at a rapid pace, it has become imperative for businesses to embrace UI/UX design. Moreover, they should consider it not just as a one-time event, but a fluid continuous part of the long-term business strategy too.
