## Customized AR filters

Have you heard about Spark AR, Facebook’s tool for building augmented reality effects? A year ago, only approved creators were allowed to use this tool to design and upload their own AR filters to Instagram. But recently, [Facebook has announced](https://tech.fb.com/creativity-for-all-facebooks-spark-ar-now-lets-anyone-build-and-share-effects-on-instagram/) that Spark AR is now accessible for everyone.

At the same time, Instagram has introduced an Effect Gallery tab that let digital artists showcase their AR filters. And currently, the number of new AR effects on Instagram is growing exponentially. The artists add dozens of new filters daily, and thousands of Instagram users discover these filters and start using them.

Experts state that new AR effects will take Instagram Stories to a brand new level. Camilla Bishman, a marketer at [Studicus](https://studicus.com/pay-someone-to-write-my-research-paper), has this to say about the growing popularity of AR filters: “In the digital age, personalization is everything. And there is no doubt that accessibility of personalized AR effects will encourage users to create more Stories and to start using Instagram more actively.”

So if you want to keep up with visual trends, you should consider creating a unique AR filter. You should design an exceptional effect that will represent your personal brand or brand of your company.

Once the effect is ready, upload it to Instagram, and encourage followers to try it out. If you do everything right, you will boost engagement and [increase brand exposure](https://www.getbeamer.com/blog/improve-brand-awareness/).

## Chat

In July 2019, Instagram introduced Chat sticker. Even though this feature was designed to enhance communication among ordinary Instagram users, it may also be beneficial for influencers and brands. Here is how you can use Chat sticker:

+ Discuss a particular issue with a specific part of your audience. For instance, you can create a separate chat to communicate with your coworkers, or with followers who live in your city.
+ Create curiosity. Everyone wants to join “a private chat room”. So if you invite your followers to participate in “secret chat”, it will skyrocket your engagement.

## Sharing feature

A year ago, Instagram users were able to share Instagram posts via direct messages only. That means that, if a post was shared ten times, it was viewed by ten Instagram users only.

But thanks to a new feature that allows users to share posts on Instagram Stories, content creators can reach a much wider audience now. According to statistics, ordinary Instagram users have, on average, from 100 to 600 followers. And it means that every post shared by one user on Stories gains at least 80 views.

So if you have a goal to grow your Instagram account, encourage your current followers to share your posts on their Stories. It will help you to reach more users and take your Instagram account to a brand new level.

Also, you can use this new feature to share user-generated content on Instagram Stories:

+ Show how much you value the opinion of your target audience.
+ Say thank you to your followers. Show how grateful you are for their loyalty and support.

Encourage followers to create more content that promotes your brand.
