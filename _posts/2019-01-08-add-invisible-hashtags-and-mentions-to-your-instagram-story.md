In this post we want to show you the absolutely best way to add invisible hashtags and mentions to your Instagram story in **4 easy steps** so stand by!

[As mentioned before](/instagram/2018/10/22/How-to-use-Hashtags-in-your-Instagram-Story.html) hashtags are important to get attention on Instagram.
By using the right hashtags you can address people on Instagram that would otherwise never be aware of your gorgeous stories.

That being said many users don’t use hashtags because they can be very frustrating to integrate.
Especially when using more than one tag they take up so much space which makes it difficult to convey your message.
Also they can look odd when they don’t fit your art style.

There are two hacks until now to make tags “invisible” either by [positioning them to the side](https://medium.com/@CasieLane/hidden-hashtag-hack-for-instagram-stories-d0c994fa7e38), which renders them unclickable. Or by [placing them on single color backgrounds and painting over them](https://www.plannthat.com/how-to-add-invisible-hashtags-to-your-instagram-story/) which restricts you very much where you can place your tags.

With [Storrito.com](https://storrito.com/) you can add truly invisible hashtags and mentions to your stories without any restrictions.

\+ Place them wherever you want  
\+ Make them as big or small you like  
\+ No fiddling with the Instagram app  
\+ Also for videos  

## How to do it the right way ##

After you have created your free Storrito account [over here](https://storrito.com/) you simply upload your image or mp4 video to your Storrito gallery. Click on it and then on “Edit” to open the Storrito editor.

Then it’s just a piece of cake to add an invisible tag to your post:
1. Add a **Text object** to your post
2. Type in **"#yourawesomehashtag"** or **"@storritofresh"**. (without **“** and don't write anything else  in the textfield otherwise it will not work)
3. **Place and scale** it however you want
4. Click on the **Textcolor** button and select the **color with the red cross** (transparent)
