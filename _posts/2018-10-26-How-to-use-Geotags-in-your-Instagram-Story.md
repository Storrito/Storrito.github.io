Instagram uses stickers with specific locations, of where you’ve stored your Instagram content. Usually the geolocations are gathered from the physical location of your mobile device, which allows users to store or tag their content to those coordinates. If you use [Storrito.com](https://app.storrito.com) with your desktop pc you can choose a geolocation freely without being at this location physically.

Posts with a tagged location result in [79% higher engagement](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-stats/) than posts without. If you are running a business and you are posting an image of one of your products or services, you should always tag your own business location in your posts. This way, if a user searches for your business on Instagram, they will see not only your own posted images and video but also those of other users.

## How to Add a geo sticker to your Instagram Story using Storrito
