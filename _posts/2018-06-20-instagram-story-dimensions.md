Many [Storrito](https://storrito.com/) users asked us: what is the
optimal resolution for an Instagram story? Therefore we've summarized
all the important details in this blog post.

<!--more-->
## Image dimensions

If you like to create a story image in Photoshop (or another tool),
you should use these dimensions to achieve the highest quality on
Instagram:

Width: **1080** px

Height: **1920** px

Consequently the aspect ratio is: **9:16**

## Video dimensions

For videos we recommend these dimensions:

Width: **720** px

Height: **1280** px

The video format should be mp4 (9:16 aspect ratio, 30 fps, h264,
yuv420p).

## Beware of the Instagram controls

Choosing the right dimensions is not the only challenge, since the
Instagram app overlays your story with a few controls for the user,
below marked in red:

<img src="/images/what-are-the-instagram-story-dimensions/screenshot_20180620-143035.jpg" alt="drawing" style="max-height: 500px" alt="Instagram Story Screenshot"/>

Ideally you have an overlay in your Photoshop file that shows the
Instagram controls, to avoid that important elements of your design
will be covered by the Instagram controls.

Last but not least you also need to plan in advance that other
Instagram elements (like the usertag and the geotag in the screenshot
above) will not interfere with your design, when you add them later
via the Instagram app.

## What a mess

You see there are many subtleties, when it comes to create a design
for an Instagram story. All the things described above happened
regular, when we designed Instagram stories in the past. Therefore we
created [Storrito](https://storrito.com/) to solve the biggest pain
points, when you like to create an Instagram story quickly on your
desktop PC, Mac or laptop.

## An easier way

Let my show you the main steps it takes to create an Instagram story
with Storrito.

After you've created your Storrito account here:

<a href="https://app.storrito.com/" target="_blank">https://app.storrito.com/</a>

You click the `Choose a file to upload` button (see green arrow)

![Step 1](/images/what-are-the-instagram-story-dimensions/step-1.jpg "Step 1")

When the upload is done, your image or video appears in the Storrito
gallery. Just click on the image to open the menu:

![Step 2](/images/what-are-the-instagram-story-dimensions/step-2.jpg "Step 2")

In the menu click `Edit this image` to open the story editor:

![Step 3](/images/what-are-the-instagram-story-dimensions/step-3.jpg "Step 3")

The story editor directly shows the Instagram story dimensions. I've
marked the corners of the story with the four little green arrows. As
you can see the image almosts fits into the story area. All parts
outside of this area are semi-transparent and will not be visible in
the Instagram story:

![Step 4](/images/what-are-the-instagram-story-dimensions/step-4.jpg "Step 4")

But we want to have a section of the image that shows more of the
beautiful beach. Therefore you can move the image or click its corners
(see green arrow) to resize it, like I did below. You can also rotate
the image (see blue arrow)

![Step 5](/images/what-are-the-instagram-story-dimensions/step-5.jpg "Step 5")

By clicking on the blue round "Add" button you can add more elements
to your story. As you can see Storrito also supports Instagram's
hashtags, usertags, location-tags and polls:

![Step 6](/images/what-are-the-instagram-story-dimensions/step-6.jpg "Step 6")

Storrito makes even more convenient :-) After you've saved your story
by clicking on the red round "Save" button. You can directly post your
story to your Instagram account (click on `Post now`) or `schedule` it
for a later point in time (see green arrow).

If you didn't connect an Instagram account yet, then the screen below
will show a button, where you can connect your Instagram account to
Storrito.

![Step 7](/images/what-are-the-instagram-story-dimensions/step-7.jpg "Step 7")

However if you like to post it manually, you can also just download
the image or video by clicking the `Download` button (see blue arrow).


I've also covered the whole topic in the tutorial video below:
