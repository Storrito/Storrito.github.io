## Top 5 Brands with the Best Instagram Stories

### [Tiffany & Co.](https://www.instagram.com/tiffanyandco/)

Tiffany & Co. is one of the most famous jewelry brands in the world, and it’s doing great on Instagram. It uses the app not only to tempt users with photos of shining diamonds but also to inform and educate its target audience.

In 2019, the company used Instagram stories to present The Tiffany Guide to Diamonds – the guide that explains how different characteristics of the diamond, including the cut, color, clarity, influence the price.

Such stories help Tiffany & Co. to attract new customers. Once people get a clear understanding of how exactly Tiffany’s products differ from cheaper alternatives, they don’t hesitate to pay a higher price.  

### [Away](https://www.instagram.com/away/)

Away is a company that sells suitcases. As for today, Away has more than 558K followers on Instagram. Can you guess what the secret of the company’s success is? The wise use of user-generated content and Instagram stories.

Here is how Away’s strategy works. The company encourages customers to create and share visual content. Every day, marketers choose from five to eight pictures published by customers and create a series of stories. They also write short captions to connect one picture to another and to convey a specific message.

If you have a goal to [scale your business](https://notbusinessasususal.com/2020/02/how-to-scale-your-business-using-different-digital-marketing-tools/), feel free to use the same approach to marketing. Try to collect as many pieces of user-generated content as possible and then try to unite them in one meaningful story.

Can’t come up with the relevant captions? Consider using writing services like [GrabMyEssay](https://www.grabmyessay.com/) and Studicus. Or, if you want to get assistance from social media consultants, visit freelance platforms like PeoplePerHour and Upwork.

But there are days when they talk about politics and encourage people to register to vote, or when they discuss charity issues and invite followers to donate. For specific purposes, they use specially designed stickers.
